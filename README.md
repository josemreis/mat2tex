Inject R matrices into LaTeX formulas
=======================================

The **mat2tex** package was written to facilitate the combination of matrices and LaTeX code.

### Installation

To install the **mat2tex** package from github enter

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("markheckmann/mat2tex")
```

into the console. Windows users have to make sure that [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is installed.

**mat2tex** is a mini-language with several operators and functions to allow to combine LaTeX code and R objects. An introduction can be found in the package vignettes as well as here (http://markheckmann.github.io/mat2tex/) (not yet available).
